I had completed 70% of the Sunshine app almost 3 months. I've started the android developer nanodegree course in Udacity
 and found they used the same app to teach. I was in a dilemma of whether to skip forward and get going with projects. But, I decided to
 redo the Sunshine app from the beginning to review my knowledge.
