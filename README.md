I had completed 70% of the Sunshine app almost 3 months. I've started the android developer nanodegree course in Udacity
 and found they used the same app to teach. I was in a dilemma of whether to skip forward and get going with projects. But, I decided to
 redo the Sunshine app from the beginning to review my knowledge.

 **Build steps**
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Create gradle.properties in the root folder
 3. Initialize the following variable in the file

    `MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey = "[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]"`

    You can get an API_KEY from <a href="http://openweathermap.org" target="_blank">Open Weather</a>

   Please report issues with log errors if not possible, screenshots will do.
